        Responsive design is all about user interface. In past years there has been so much development in internet, its application and devices that can run it. In the market there are various screen sizes. To run the websites that fits perfectly depending on the screen, responsive design comes as a tool that allow us to make responsive web page. The website which has responsive design automatically adapts the screen size and applies the media queries that is written in CSS and displays the relative design.

        In the early internet era, there were not many types of screens available which could run the websites on internet as well as there were not many applications specifically designed for various screen. In the current scenario the amount and type of displays are indefinite, Web sites are so popular among the public and itâ€™s an essential part of life. To address this issue responsive design is a key technology. Even the web browser viewport in computer being made small or big depending upon need. With the help of responsive design web site can shuffle its elements that make sense from screen size point of view. For example, for big screen the same website can show more information but if the view port has small real estate, then only important component which is required can be shown. It has great advantage such as it can grow immense traffic to website. Working with responsive design can potentially lower the cost of the development because company would save budget and time for mobile development. The website developed with responsive design are futureproof as well because there is constant innovation of device and technologies.

        It was a great learning about the responsive design. In this process of I learned about the core concept and principal about responsive design. I learned how to configure a site using CSS for different viewport as well as orientation. To achieve it, I learned CSS box model and learned how to use it properly. I made different media queries to address different viewport and orientation and made relative CSS properties for the components where I made the breakpoints to identify where the CSS rule will be applied. I gathered it on bottom part of the CSS document which makes it clear and understandable if anyone look at the code. I put my concept of making the website simple and user friendly by choosing appropriate color, theme, fonts, and the style.

        It was a great learning experience of web222 in Seneca with prof Tanvir Alam. We started with JavaScript which was hard pard (for me) but once HTML and CSS came, it was very enjoyable because I could see the real changes on website which was being made on the IDE . Being a visual learner, I understand better with visual medium. I really believe I can do better with web development especially front-end web development after taking this class. The practical test as well as the assignment were helpful to make good foundation for web development.
